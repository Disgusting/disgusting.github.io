        <h1>Real-time Visual Effects Guidebook</h1>
        <div class="grid">
            <div>
                In video games, visual effects (VFX) do more than add flair, they shape player experiences, guiding
                emotions, focus, and interaction. This guidebook delves into the core principles of real-time VFX
                design, exploring how motion, shape, and colour contribute to immersion and intrinsic rewards. By
                understanding these principles, VFX artists can craft effects that not only enhance gameplay but also
                deepen player engagement.

        <div class="grid">

                <p class="box">
                    Timing plays a critical role in creating immersive game experiences. One of the primary ways timing
                    affects
                    players is through its influence on flow states—mental conditions where players are fully absorbed
                    in
                    the
                    game and lose track of time.

        <div class="grid">
            <div>
                <h4>Non-linear timing</h4>
                <p>
                    Non-linear easing, or “easing,” adds flair by controlling how motion speeds up or slows down.
                    Techniques like overshooting, where movement extends slightly beyond its target,
                    create visually satisfying animations. This exaggeration enhances simple actions, like
                    opening a door, by adding weight and momentum, making interactions feel more impactful and
                    realistic, boosting player satisfaction.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Anticipation and Dissipation</h4>
                <p>
                    Anticipation is the building of tension before big moments, like a pause before a character swings a
                    weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dissipation follows the action, slowing movement to give a sense of completion. Together, these
                    timing elements reduce visual clutter and improve readability, creating a more immersive experience
                    for players.

                <h4>Motion attributes</h4>
                <p>
                    Motion attributes refer to the specific characteristics of movement—such as speed, direction,
                    rhythm, and smoothness—that can evoke emotions and enhance the aesthetic quality of animations.
                    Insights from these attributes aim to elevate design in media, visualisations, interactive art, and
                    immersive experiences, making them more emotionally engaging and visually appealing.

        <div class="grid">
            <div>
                <p class="box">
                    Simplifying shapes and maintaining clear associations between objects helps players understand
                    gameplay
                    mechanics quickly and intuitively. This reduces confusion and enhances focus, making the gaming
                    experience more streamlined and enjoyable.

                <h4>Simple Shapes</h4>
                <p>
                    Humans tend to perceive objects as whole forms before analysing their individual parts. This is
                    closely related to the global-precedence hypothesis, which suggests that global shapes or overall
                    structures are processed first, followed by the details or smaller components. In VFX design, this
                    concept is applied to ensure that important visual cues are immediately understood by the player,
                    reducing cognitive load and allowing them to focus on critical gameplay elements.

            <div>
                <h4>Distinguishable</h4>
                <p>
                    The effect should be distinguishable from their background to ensuring that
                    important visual elements stand out against their surroundings allows players to focus on key
                    interactions and avoid being overwhelmed by unnecessary details.

        <h2>3. Colour</h2>

            <div>
                <p class="box">
                    Color plays a significant role in directing player attention and evoking emotional responses.
                    Understanding
                    the impact of colour saturation, palette choices, and the use of complementary and analogous colours
                    helps
                    VFX artists design visually cohesive effects that enhance the player's focus and experience.

                <h4>Saturation Range</h4>
                <p>
                    VFX that utilises a higher saturation range can draw more focus to important gameplay elements.
                    However, it is important to avoid extreme saturation for regular in-game elements, reserving those
                    extremes for UI or particularly significant events.

                <p>
                    The the concept of overshoot, where the action—be it physical or colour-based—exaggerates past the
                    intended point before settling down. This technique can create more dynamic and engaging visual
                    effects, drawing player attention through gradual colour transitions.
