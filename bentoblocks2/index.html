                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                <p>During the early prototyping of Bento Blocks, we conducted user testing with friends to gather
                    preliminary feedback. This helped shape our UI and UX, balancing usability and thematic (Cozy)
                    consistency.
                    Below is a summary of the feedback we received, along with our design responses to enhance gameplay
                    and interface clarity.</p>

                <h3> Summary of Player Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enable cutting while holding the knife for continuous interactions.</li>
                    <li>Clarify objectives and the star reward system.</li>
                    <li>Enhance cutting interactions for a more satisfying.</li>
                    <li>Players appreciated that the game could be completed with any number of cuts.</li>
                    <li>Some players found the interface difficult to navigate. They did not know how to use the knife.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a grid overlay to help players visualize the game space.</li>
                    <li>Improve clarity around the knife’s functionality. Some players were a little lost</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Design Response: Reactive-Cursor</h3>

                <p>
                    To enhance player interaction clarity and subtly teach players about their actions in a diegetic
                    context, a reactive cursor system was implemented. We made the cursor dynamically adjusts the sprite
                    based on the item held and the object beneath it, hoping to providing players with immediate
                    visual feedback and intuitive guidance without explicit instructions.</p>
                <p>
                    Drawing on Don Norman’s principles of <em>feedback</em> and <em>affordances</em> from <em>The Design
                        of Everyday Things</em> This design feature aims to create effective feedback that reinforces
                    game-mechanics understanding <a href="#ref1" id="cite1">[1]</a>.

            <div class="col-25">
                <p>Another design response we developed to teach players the controls is a simple diegetic tutorial that
                    responds to player input. While still in an early stage, this tutorial effectively guides players
                    through interactive feedback. Future iterations will incorporate animations to better communicate
                    player actions and their consequences, enhancing clarity and engagement.</p>
